1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
This is the General Form of a

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,716
quintic polynomial equation in one variable, x.

3
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:08,963
We could solve it easily if we

4
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:12,260
didn't have all these intermediate x powers.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,735
To make a start, we might first try to get

6
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:19,460
rid of the quartic, or x to the fourth, term.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,140
In other words, transform it into so-called reduced form,

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,476
where the coefficient of this term is zero.

9
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:32,324
This operation is technically known as a Tschirnhaus Transformation,

10
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:37,755
the simplest example of which is a linear substitution,

11
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,916
such as x = z + some constant h.

12
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:46,052
Let's use this to express all these x powers in terms of z.

13
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:52,932
Expand these powers.

14
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:58,508
Multiply out the binomials.

15
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,868
Distribute the original coefficients.

16
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:13,098
Now recall that this first z equation is

17
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,724
just the sum of the six below it.

18
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:20,986
All seven of these equations are identities, true

19
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:24,476
for every choice of x and corresponding z.

20
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:28,363
If we now consider the case z equals one, then

21
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:32,420
all of these z powers disappear from the matrix.

22
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:39,407
Now we can read the matrix column by column, to get

23
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:44,572
expressions for the new coefficients in terms of the original ones.

24
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:48,514
This H substitution avoids a lot of ugly fractions

25
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:52,300
with powers of five denominators in the results.

26
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:10,940
Finally we have succeeded in eliminating the quartic term.
